# OOP-NOTES
# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Class

Class is a **blue print to create an object**

## Object

An object is an **instance of a class**

## Constructor

A _Constructor_ is a function that is used to initialize properties of an object.

## Four Pillars of OOP

- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

### Encapsulation

_The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components._

### Inheritance

_Ability to create child class from parent class._

### Abstraction

_Abstraction means to "show" only essential attributes and "hide" unnecessary information._

### Polymorphism

_Polymorphism is a greek word that literally means many forms. It allows objects of different classes to respond differently based on the same message._

## Static Properties and Methods

**Static Properties** belong to class and not to objects.

**Static Methods** belong to class and not to objects and they are used to perform a utility function.

## Abstract Classes and Methods

Abstract classes and methods are when the parent class has a named method, but need its child class(es) to fill out the tasks.

**An abstract class** is a class that contains at least one abstract method. **An abstract method** is a method that is declared, but not implemented in the code.

An abstract class or method is defined with the _abstract_ keyword.

Overriding

Access Modifiers - public, private & protected
